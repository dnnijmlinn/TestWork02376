Tasks Accomplished:
Implemented custom fields for the product using the WooCommerce plugin. Used coding techniques rather than relying on third-party plugins for creating the custom fields.

In the product backend section, the following additional fields have been introduced:

An image upload field with an option to remove the uploaded image.
A date field indicating when the product was created.
A dropdown select box for choosing the product type: rare, frequent, or unusual.
Added a button (implemented with JavaScript) that clears all custom fields.

Added a button (implemented with JavaScript) to submit or update the product changes.
